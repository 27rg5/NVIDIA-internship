This repository contains the main code I wrote during my NVIDIA internship. 

My pipeline -

Datasets used: 
1. [VoxCeleb](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/)
2. [VGGFace](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/vgg_face/)

The researchers of [Reconstructing faces from voices](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10604) paper converted the audio data into their respective Log Mel-Spectrograms, which were used for my GAN models.
